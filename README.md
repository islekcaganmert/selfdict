# SelfDict

An app to track all words learned in a language.
Made as a companion to language learners.

### How to Use?

Planned to be live on [my PythonAnywhere site](https://islekcaganmert.pythonanywhere.com/Apps/SelfDict).

### How to Self-Host?

All data kept on your account using [TheProtocols](https://github.com/islekcaganmert/theprotocols) which means this is only a client and have interopability.
You can use any client.
To self-host your data, please look for [OpenServer](https://github.com/islekcaganmert/openserver), following steps for client hosting:

1. Download latest `.whl` from Releases page on right.
2. Install the module using `pip install SelfDict_0.0.0.whl`, replace 0.0.0 with the version you are installing.
3. Run client using `python3 -m selfdict`

> [!WARNING]
> If you install it into a virtual environment, you must activate it before running.
